# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

TODO: Describe the pages folder and include link to documentation. Don't forget about ordering of pages.

All the Home pages feature buttons that navigate users to specific functionality, tailored to their respective personas. Each button directs users to a dedicated page for the associated action. For instance, every persona with a "View Applications" button on their home page is linked to a shared Get_Applications page.
